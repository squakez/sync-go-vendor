Synchronize a (downstream) GIT repository with changes performed in another (upstream) GIT repository.

Usage: sync-cherry-pick.sh <downstream_org/repo/branch> --upstream <upstream_org/repo/branch> [options]

    --no-cherry-pick          Don't cherry pick the commits (will list them only)
-i, --interactive             Enable cherry pick interactive mode (useful to run from a local machine)
-u, --upstream                Upstream org/repository/branch from where to sync
-f, --force                   Clean any support files previously created
-h, --help                    This help message
